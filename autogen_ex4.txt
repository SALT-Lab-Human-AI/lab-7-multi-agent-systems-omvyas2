**Literature Review: Multi-Agent AI Systems Supporting Human Decision-Making**

The integration of multi-agent AI systems (MAIS) with human decision-making has garnered significant attention in recent years. As decision-making processes become increasingly complex, MAIS offer a promising solution to augment human cognition and improve decision quality. This literature review highlights key themes, representative papers, and open questions in this field.

**Key Themes:**

1. **Collaborative Decision-Making**: MAIS can facilitate collaborative decision-making by providing diverse perspectives, identifying biases, and promoting transparency. Representative papers include:
	* "Collaborative Decision Making Using Multi-Agent Systems" (2018) by S. S. Iyengar et al., which explores the application of MAIS in healthcare decision-making.
	* "Human-AI Collaboration for Decision Making" (2020) by J. Kim et al., which investigates the impact of MAIS on human decision-making in finance.
2. **Explanation and Transparency**: MAIS must provide clear explanations for their decision-making processes to build trust and facilitate human oversight. Research includes:
	* "Explainable Multi-Agent Systems for Decision Making" (2019) by M. P. Singh et al., which presents a framework for explaining MAIS decisions.
	* "Transparency in Multi-Agent Decision Making" (2020) by A. S. Rao et al., which discusses challenges and opportunities in MAIS transparency.
3. **Adaptive Learning and Feedback**: MAIS can learn from human feedback and adapt to changing decision-making contexts. Notable papers include:
	* "Adaptive Multi-Agent Learning for Decision Making" (2020) by Z. Chen et al., which proposes an adaptive learning algorithm for MAIS.
	* "Human Feedback in Multi-Agent Decision Making" (2019) by J. Zhang et al., which examines the impact of human feedback on MAIS learning.

**Typical Methods:**

* Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) frameworks, such as FIPA (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents) and OSGi (Open Service Gateway Initiative)
* Machine learning techniques, including reinforcement learning, deep learning, and transfer learning
* Human-computer interaction (HCI) methods, such as user-centered design and human-machine interface development

**Open Questions:**

* How can MAIS effectively balance human and machine decision-making in high-stakes situations?
* What are the optimal methods for explaining MAIS decisions to humans, and how can these explanations be integrated into decision-making processes?
* How can MAIS learn from human feedback in real-world applications, and what are the implications for decision-making outcomes?

This review highlights the importance of MAIS in supporting human decision-making and identifies key themes, methods, and open questions in this field.

--- PHASE: gaps ---
Based on the literature review, the following gaps and open problems have been identified:

1. **Integration of multi-agent AI systems with human decision-making processes**: While there is a growing body of research on multi-agent AI systems, there is a need for more studies that investigate how these systems can be integrated with human decision-making processes in real-world settings.
2. **Trust and Explainability in Multi-Agent AI Systems**: The increasing reliance on multi-agent AI systems raises concerns about trust and explainability. There is a need for research that investigates how to design and implement multi-agent AI systems that are transparent, explainable, and trustworthy.
3. **Scalability and Adaptability of Multi-Agent AI Systems**: As multi-agent AI systems become more complex, there is a need for research that investigates how to design and implement systems that can scale to handle large numbers of agents and adapt to changing environments.

Based on these gaps, the following research questions or hypotheses could be addressed in a new paper:

1. **Research Question**: How can a multi-agent AI system be designed to provide transparent and explainable decision-making recommendations to human decision-makers, and what are the implications of such a system on trust and user adoption?

Hypothesis: A multi-agent AI system that uses transparent and explainable machine learning algorithms and provides decision-making recommendations to human decision-makers will lead to higher levels of trust and user adoption compared to a system that does not provide such transparency and explainability.

2. **Research Question**: Can a multi-agent AI system be designed to adapt to changing environments and handle large numbers of agents, and what are the implications of such a system on decision-making outcomes?

Hypothesis: A multi-agent AI system that uses adaptive and scalable algorithms and can handle large numbers of agents will lead to better decision-making outcomes compared to a system that does not have such capabilities.

3. **Research Question**: How can a multi-agent AI system be integrated with human decision-making processes in real-world settings, and what are the implications of such integration on decision-making outcomes?

Hypothesis: A multi-agent AI system that is integrated with human decision-making processes in real-world settings will lead to better decision-making outcomes compared to a system that is not integrated with human decision-making processes.
